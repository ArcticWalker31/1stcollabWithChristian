There was an error in the git commit because these files were too long. I put them in 
this folder to shorten it, but in order for the unity to work, you need to put them back manually where they go.

They go in here:
\1stcollabWithChristian\GameFiles\TeamDefender\Assets\Photon\PhotonUnityNetworking\Demos\PunCockpit
